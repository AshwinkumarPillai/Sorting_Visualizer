# Sorting Visualizer

This project helps visualize how sorting algorithms work.

## Features

### v1.0.0

- Can adjust speed of the visualization
- Can increase or decrease the number of elements in the array
- choose 3 different algorithms - bubble, selection and insertion sort

## Algorithms covered

### v1.0.0

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort

## TODO

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Time and Space Complexity details
- Actual time taken by algorithms

Major update - Side by side comparison of algorithms with visualization and actual time taken
