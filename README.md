2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort

## Updates

### v1.0.0

Basic App with 3 algos

### v1.0.1

Added support for Mobile devices
Ability to see actual number on the individual element (only for laptop and above)

## TODO

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Time and Space Complexity details
- Actual time taken by algorithms

Major update - Side by side comparison of algorithms with visualization and actual time taken
