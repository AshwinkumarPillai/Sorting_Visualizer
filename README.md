# Sorting Visualizer

This project helps visualize how sorting algorithms work.

Website - https://ash-sorting-visualizer.netlify.app/

## Algorithms covered

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort

## Features

### v1.0.0

- Can adjust speed of the visualization
- Can increase or decrease the number of elements in the array
- choose 3 different algorithms - bubble, selection and insertion sort

### v1.0.1

- Added support for Mobile devices
- Ability to see actual number on the individual element (only for laptop and above)

### v1.1.0

- Merge Sort Visualization Added

### v2.0.0

- Refactored Code
- Shifted Sorting logic to individual files using funcitonal components
- changed website logo

## TODO

- Quick Sort
- Time and Space Complexity details
- Actual time taken by algorithms

Major update - Side by side comparison of algorithms with visualization and actual time taken
